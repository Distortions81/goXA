# GoXA -- Go eXpress Archive

**GoXA** is a custom archival format and tool written in Go. It provides a simple, efficient, and feature-rich alternative to traditional archival formats like tar or zip, with an emphasis on data integrity, flexibility, and extensibility.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development**: This project is still experimental and under active development. Expect bugs, untested behavior, and breaking changes. Use at your own risk.<br>

## Features

- ‚úÖ Fast archive creation and extraction
- ‚úÖ Per-file compression (gzip, optional)
- ‚úÖ Per-file checksums (BLAKE2b-256, optional)
- ‚úÖ Preservation of permissions and modification timestamps (optional)
- ‚úÖ Empty directory support
- ‚úÖ Simple, fully documented binary format ([file-format.md](file-format.md))
- ‚úÖ Optional support for symlinks and other special files (new flag)
- ‚úÖ Clean Go codebase, easy to extend
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies, self-contained

## File Format

The full GoXA binary file format is documented here: [file-format.md](file-format.md).

## Install

You can build GoXA easily using Go 1.20+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Distortions81/goXA.git
cd goXA
go build
```

This will produce the `goxa` binary.

## Usage

### Command Syntax

```
goxa [mode][options] -arc=archiveFile [additional arguments]
```

- `mode` (required): one of:
  - `c` = create
  - `l` = list contents
  - `x` = extract

- `options` (optional): any combination of the following single-character flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `a` | Store absolute paths |
| `p` | Preserve file/directory permissions |
| `m` | Preserve modification timestamps |
| `s` | Enable BLAKE2b checksums |
| `n` | Disable compression |
| `i` | Include invisible files |
| `o` | Include special files (symlinks, devices) |
| `v` | Verbose logging |
| `f` | Force overwrite existing files / ignore read errors |


Paths are stored relative to the given inputs by default. Use `a` when
extracting to write files to their original absolute locations. If `a` is not
specified for extraction, any absolute paths in the archive are recreated under
the chosen destination directory.

### Additional Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-arc=` | Specify archive file name |
| `-stdout` | Output archive to stdout |
| `-progress=false` | Disable progress display |

Progress output shows transfer speed and the current file being processed.

### Examples

**Create Archive:**

```bash
goxa c -arc=mybackup.goxa myStuff/
```

**Full backup (like tar+gz):**

```bash
goxa capmsif -arc=mybackup.goxa ~/
```

**Extract Archive:**

```bash
goxa x -arc=mybackup.goxa
```

**List Archive Contents:**

```bash
goxa l -arc=mybackup.goxa
```

## Roadmap Ideas

- ‚úÖ Format documentation (complete)
- üõ† Working relative path support
- üõ† Add modes to allow non-files (symlinks, devices)
- üõ† Random-access extraction mode
- üõ† Multi-threaded archive optimization (blocks, v2 format)
- üõ† Additional compression formats
- üõ† Go 1.24+ os.Root directory jails
- üõ† Archive signatures for optional additional security
- üõ† Archive comment field
- üõ† Encrypted archives

## Security Notes

- **Archive extraction uses path sanitization** to prevent directory traversal, but
  enabling the `a` option allows files to be written to absolute paths. An
  attacker could overwrite arbitrary files if you extract an untrusted archive
  with `a` enabled.
- Existing symbolic links in the destination are not resolved before writing
  files. A malicious archive might exploit symlinks to write outside the target
  directory when extracting with absolute paths.
- File sizes stored in the archive are truncated to Go's `int64` before copying.
  Extremely large or corrupted size fields may panic the extractor.
- Command-line option parsing currently shortens the options string while
  iterating, which could lead to unexpected failures if the program misreads the
  provided flags.
